<h1 align="center">*Worlds* terminal client</h1>

This is a CLI (command-line interface) app that runs ***Worlds***, a text-based world simulation and role-playing game toolkit. With *Worlds*, you can create a virtual world and play a character in it.

> [!NOTE]
> *Worlds* is in very early development and not yet playableâ€”it's just an empty shell *(pun intended)*.

This CLI app works on MacOS and Linux. Later on I plan on making it playable via a web interface as well.

You can follow the development of *Worlds* in the blog series "Building a text-based game in Ruby":
